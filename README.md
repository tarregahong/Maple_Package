# MAPLE Package
Maple package files from [Frank G. Garvan](http://www.qseries.org/fgarvan/research.html).

To see a breif guide about building package files from his txt files easily, please check 'Building Guide.pdf'.



If you want to install packages easily, just copy the .m or .mla file located in [Package](https://github.com/tarregahong/Maple_Package/tree/master/Package) into your Maple library. Using qseries.m for instance, my Maple is installed to D:\Program Files\Maple 18. There is a folder named "lib". After copying qseries.m to this folder, restart Maple and we can use "with(qseries)" in Maple to test whether we have added the package successfully.
